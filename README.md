# block-shooter-portable

A portable version of my main game **“Block Shooter”**, built using  
[Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

This project is worked on *alongside* the main game as a flexible version that
can be forked and ported to different platforms over time.

- The original game’s repository is **not yet public**
- The main version is made in **Unity 2020 LTS**
- This repo is intended to help with future ports, including:

  - Nintendo DS
  - Nintendo 64 *(not confirmed)*
  - Wii U *(if I do not receive developer Unity tools soon)*
  - Nintendo Switch
